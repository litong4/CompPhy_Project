Ising model is a simple but important model to explain ferromagnetism. 
However, only one- and two-dimensional cases have been solved analytically. 
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a numerical method for the simulation of Ising model. 
In this work we focus on the application of Metropolis algorithm to the solve two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. 
We benchmark our numerical results with the analytical solution, 
and confirm that the system has a proper probability distribution and converges quickly to equilibrium in our simulation. 
The behaviors of phase transition around critical temperature also agree well with the analytical solution, 
and the critical temperature of infinitely large lattice is estimated to be 2.265 from our simulation, 
which is quite close to the theoretical value 2.269. 
Our work shows the success of Metropolis algorithm in the simulation of Ising model and 
we can simply extend it to higher dimensions.
