In this report we investigate the Monte Carlo method for the simulation of two-dimensional Ising model. 
Ising model is a simple but important model to explain ferromagnetism, and 2D case has an analytical solution which can be used to benchmark numerical methods. 
First we discuss the analytical results of $2 \times 2$ case and the properties of phase transition in 2D Ising model. 
Then we apply Metropolis algorithm to simulate 2D Ising model with different lattice size $L$. 
Our numerical results of $L=2$ case agrees well with the analytical values, 
and we study $L=20$ case to confirm that the system converges fast to equilibrium in the simulation. 
As expected the energy distribution centers around the mean value and a higher temperature leads to a broader distribution. 
We also study the phase transition in 2D Ising model with different lattice size $L$, 
and obtain how energy, magnetization, heat capacity and susceptibility per spin changes with temperature around $T_C$. 
The behaviors of these quantities agree well with the analytical solution. 
From the peak of susceptibility we estimate that the critical temperature for infinitely large lattice is 2.265, 
which is close to the analytical value 2.269.

Our work shows the power of Metropolis algorithm in the application of solving Ising model, 
which can be easily extended to three-dimensional case in the future.
