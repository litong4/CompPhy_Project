For flexibility and extensivity of our codes, the idea of object-oriented programming is employed in the development. 
A class called "planet" stores all the properties of a planet, such as coordinate, velocity, acceleration, total force on it, 
angular momentum and energy. 
This class also contains functions to initialize before each time step, to calculate gravitational force between two objects, 
to add up these forces, to do one-step Euler's forward or Velocity-Verlet calculation and to update all the properties after each step. 
The user can fix one or more objects can be fixed at a given position, 
and he/she can also call a friend function to move the center of mass to origin. 
All the parameters of planets in the system are given from command line and input file.
