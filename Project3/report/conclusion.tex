In this work, we investigate two methods, Euler's forward and Velocity-Verlet method, 
to solve a set of first-order ordinary differential equations with initial conditions. 
To test the performance of these algorithms, 
we use them to calculate the evolution of the Earth-Sun, Earth-Sun-Jupiter and whole solar system. 
Our comparison shows that the Verlet method can better describe the characteristics of motion in these systems than Euler's method. 
We conclude that Verlet method is more stable and thus better to use. 
We also use Verlet method to calculate the perihelion precession of Mercury by adding a relativistic correction to the gravitational force 
and obtain a $43''$ per century precession which is the same as the analytical solution.
